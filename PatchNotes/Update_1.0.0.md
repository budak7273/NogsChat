Update 8 support. Slash command completion. Code cleanup. This update brought to you by Robb#6731.




## New Stuff

- Press TAB to autocomplete the slash command you're typing
  - See it in action here: <https://streamable.com/ry33nz> (not sure why the HUD is flashing in the video, it doesn't do that in-game)

## Changed Stuff

- Simplified how the mod detects the chat window opening and closing, which probably fixed unreported bugs in previous version
- Improved the help tooltip that appears to the right of the chat box
- Added extra details to when the /font command fails (invalid font size)

## Known Bugs

There are no known bugs, however, keep in mind that these two base-game bugs currently affect the chat window:

- [Pressing escape to close chat requires pressing enter twice to open it next time](https://questions.satisfactorygame.com/post/64c4673e87a1e63b6cee92c3)
- [Clicking in the chat history scrollbox locks you into the chat widget](https://questions.satisfactorygame.com/post/64c4686487a1e63b6cee92c5)
