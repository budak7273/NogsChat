**This mod works in multiplayer - host and client can have separate settings.**

See the mod icon for an example screenshot.

This mod enhances the in-game Chat and lets you...

- Adjust the font size (8, 10, 12, 14, 16 accepted)
  - Fit more messages on screen at once, or make the chat window take up less space
  - Clients must use the Mod Configs screen (not the chat commands) to change the configs for the client side.
- Store history of your past entered commands, stored per-game save file.
  - Use the Up and Down arrow keys to navigate command history while chat is open
  - 100 items saved by default, configurable from the Mod Configs screen.
- Press TAB to autocomplete the slash command you're typing
  - See it in action here: <https://streamable.com/ry33nz> (HUD flashing in the video due to a graphics issue with my recording software, it doesn't do that in-game)

Configure these settings via chat commands (explained by a help tooltip in-game) or from the Mod Configs screen.
